# ShrinkIT-File-compression-using-huffman-coding
ShrinkIt is a file compression tool that utilizes Huffman coding, an efficient algorithm for lossless data compression. By leveraging variable-length prefix coding, ShrinkIt optimizes storage space and reduces transmission time without sacrificing data integrity. - Implement Huffman coding to compress files effectively 



# File Compression and Decompression

## To run the script 
* Download the code.
* Run `python main.py`.
* Enter `1` and the path of the file you want to compess.
* Enter `2` and the path of the compressed file to get the **OG** file.
* And enter `0` to terminate the program.
